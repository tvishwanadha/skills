These rules extend the default patterns review rules.

## Rules

- Consult the `plugins-guide` skill via the Skill tool for structural conventions, naming, and manifest patterns (which references `plugin-dev:plugin-structure`)
- Consult the `skills-guide` skill via the Skill tool for skill directory and frontmatter naming conventions (which references `plugin-dev:skill-development`)
